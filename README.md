# Medical-Image-Processing
This repository contains some works that I have done in [Computation Radiology Lab UR Medical Center](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/wismueller.aspx).

It mainly contains the following parts:

- Phase contrast X-ray computed tomography (PCI-CT) deep learning classifier. 
- Vertebrae Segmentation in Pathological Spine CT via Fully Convolutional Neural Network.
- Preprocessing of Raw image data (.mhd/.raw/.dicom) of [Annotated lymph node CT dataset](http://www.holgerroth.com/data) and [Microsoft's Spine Web dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kbnzg63447hx3eq/AACy8dQ01YM-0IEwYK4vVJ3Na?dl=0)
